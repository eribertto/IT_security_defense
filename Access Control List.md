An access control list or ACL, is a way of defining permissions or
authorizations for objects. The most common case you may encounter deals with
file system permissions. A file system would have an ACL, which is a table or
database with a list of entries specifying access rights for individuals or
groups for various objects on the file system like folders, files or programs.
These individual access permissions per object are called Access Control Entries
and they make up the ACL. Individual entries can define permissions controlling
whether or not a user or group can read, write or execute objects. ACLs are also
used extensively in network security, applying access controls to routers
switches and firewalls. Network ACLs are used for restricting and controlling
access to hoster services running on hosts within your network. Network ACLs can
be defined for incoming and outgoing traffic. They can also be used to restrict
external access to systems and limit outgoing traffic to enforce policies or to
prevent unauthorized outbound data transfers. We'll deep dive more into network
ACLs in future lessons when we cover network security in more detail.
