TACACS+ pronounced TACACS plus. It stands for Terminal Access controller
Access-Control System Plus. It's a Cisco developed AAA protocol that was
released as an open standard in 1993. It replaced the older TACACS protocol
developed in 1984 for MILNET. The unclassified network for DARPA, which later
evolved into NIPRNet. TACACS+ also took the place of XTACACS or Extended TACACS
which was a Cisco proprietary extension on top of TACACS. TACACS+ is primarily
used for device administration, authentication, authorization, and accounting,
as opposed to RADIUS, which is mostly used for network access AAA. It's
important to call out these differences in the characteristics of what these
services provide. Though the differences are primarily related to the
authorization, and accounting portions, more so than authentication. While you
might not encounter a TACACS+ implementation in the course of your support
career, it's something that you should be aware of. TACACS+ is mainly used as an
authentication system for network infrastructure devices, which tend to be high
value targets for attackers. This may be something to consider implementing as
your organization grows.
